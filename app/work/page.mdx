<Small>Frontend Engineer, Feb 2023 - Mar 2024</Small>

Aba, Nigeria, has been a manufacturing hub since the early 1900s, and I had the privilege of contributing to an iconic project [Abamade](https://abamade.com.ng/). As part of a team of engineers working across web and mobile, I helped build an application designed to connect manufacturers and retailers, streamlining access to locally crafted products.

Beyond development, I led my team in successfully launching an MVP, which we presented to the state governor as a testament to the platform’s potential impact on the local economy.
