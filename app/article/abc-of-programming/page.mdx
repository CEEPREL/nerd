## Don’t Think The Usual Way

In our daily lives, you will agree with me that understanding how our mind works is key. Our thoughts steer the ship of our actions, prompting us to actively navigate them in the right direction.

Let’s define the audience from here — if the idea of sharpening your problem-solving skills feels like a heavy load, kudos for sticking around. But if you’re all about smart thinking and savvy actions, you are in the right space.

Now, to the curious minds — those hungry for inventive problem-solving hacks in business, career, and everyday life. And for those trying to jump into the tech journey, consider this your starting point.

This article will make you discover how learning to program a computer isn’t just about code but about gaining super thinking powers. It’s a tool that lets you crack problems not just in tech but in all areas of life. If you’re curious, ambitious, and itching for self-improvement, consider this article your anchor.

### The Big Leap: 1.0

Over my journey as a Developer, I’ve seen more people being intimidated by the cryptographic nature of programs on screen than understanding how it really works. I want you to envision all coding jargons as a normal plain text that you can understand — a fundamental shift that I refer to as **THE BIG LEAP 1.0**.

Another step to eradicate the ambiguity that you think of when you see a block of code is to take the bold step of looking into the code. Scan through for syntax you can grasp. Doing this is also a big leap to understand how to code — **THE BIG LEAP 2.0**.

In the later sections of this article, you’ll gain insights into basic coding syntax and their functionalities, empowering you to identify them at a glance in any code block.

If you’ve read till this point, then this article is for you!

## Why They Are Smarter

Why do those early folks often get labeled as geniuses? It’s not some magic, but a knack for problem-solving. They aren’t born geniuses; they just fine-tune their problem-solving skills early on. This skill set becomes their secret weapon, allowing them to tackle any challenge with ease and climb the success ladder. The good news? You can start honing these skills now — there’s nothing holding you back.

And here’s the connection between coding and brainpower — it’s similar to reading a book or learning any skill. Learning to code isn’t just about mastering a programming language; it’s a workout for your brain. Problem-solving in coding engages the same mental muscles as solving puzzles in a book or mastering a new skill. It’s not just about the code; it’s about forging a resilient, problem-solving brain that can unravel challenges effortlessly.

So, if you’re keen on flexing those mental muscles, consider coding not just a technical skill but a holistic brain-building exercise. The only limit is the one you set for yourself. Ready to unleash the genius within? Dive into the world of coding, and let your brain embark on a transformative journey.

## It’s Your Turn

It’s high time you understand how to speak to a machine. Think of it this way: Programming is the art of giving instructions, and coding is the unique language that facilitates this communication.

Recognizing that computers are only tools that simplify our tasks is essential. To set them in motion, we engage in a conversation with them using a special language (coding). Conversing with computers, once perceived as complex, has evolved into a more straightforward process. Now, we can articulate our instructions using simple English commands.

Before delving into programming, let’s explore just a few diverse branches of it. Keeping it straightforward, we will outline five key programming aspects and the languages mostly used:

1. **Web Development** (JavaScript)
2. **Mobile Development** (Kotlin — Android, Swift — iOS)
3. **Game Development** (C++)
4. **Data Science** (Python)
5. **Robotics** (C#)

Choosing a programming path is important. For now, we will discuss web development — considered a relatively accessible domain with ease of assimilation. Subsequent discussions will reveal the intricacies of web development, showcasing its extensive capabilities.

Coding is more than just rules and symbols; it’s like going on a journey. Your steps are as important as your destination. Alongside learning technical stuff, you also get better at being precise, paying attention, managing time, solving problems creatively, and communicating effectively. These skills go beyond coding, depending on how much you want to learn.

So, start this coding adventure! It’s not only about machines — it’s about understanding a language that leads you to a smarter version of yourself, where each line of code tells a story of solving problems and making you a superhuman when it begins to manifest in your daily activities.

### Get Familiar: Interacting with a Computer

Imagine having a shelf with five books, and you want your sibling to read out the title of the fourth book.

Let me introduce you to programming by asking the computer to perform the task you gave your sibling with a few lines of code.

### JavaScript Example

First, let's declare the shelf variable with five books.

<CodeBlock>
  {`
let shelf = ["Think and Grow Rich", "Four-Hour Work Week", "The Power of I AM", "Eat That Frog", "Harry Potter"];
`}
</CodeBlock>

The `let` keyword instructs (or declares) the computer to store all the books in the `shelf` variable, assigning the items to it. You can replace `let` with `var` or `const`. The square brackets indicate an **Array** of items, and words in quotes are **strings**. Commas separate the items in the list.

Now, let’s access the fourth book from the shelf.

<CodeBlock>
  {`
shelf[3];
`}
</CodeBlock>

The reason we use `[3]` is because JavaScript arrays are **zero-indexed**, meaning the first element starts at index `0`. So `shelf[3]` will give us the fourth item in the list.

You might wonder why we chose [3] in the shelf. This is because JavaScript starts its index count from 0, making 0 the first book on the shelf.

By grasping this example, you’re ahead of those who are unfamiliar with coding. Your coding skill is becoming DANGEROUS. Always be on the lookout for these syntax patterns when deciphering code, and you’ll be on the path to fluently speaking the coding language, enhancing your intelligence.
